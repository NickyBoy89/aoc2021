# AOC 2021

My repository for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Running

Most of the solutions are written in `go`, for those do the following:

1. `cd` into the correct directory (ex: `day1`)
2. Edit the code to either use day 1 or 2
3. `go build` to compile the binary
4. `./<binary name>` to run the resulting binary
